Docker-Ocsigen
==============

This repository provides sources for a simple Ocsigen base image to use with Docker.


This repository is used to build the *ocsigen/ocsigen* image available on Docker's hub, listed on our [Docker profile](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/ocsigen/).


You can also use it to build your own base image by simply pulling this repository and typing `docker build -t ocsigen .` at its root.


Thanks to @avsm for the initial basis for this Dockerfile and the opamsudo helper.
